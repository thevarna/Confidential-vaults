Encifher Vaults is a full-stack decentralized application that combines a Next.js frontend with Solana blockchain programs and external encryption services. The application's primary innovation is the integration of encrypted token operations through a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) gateway, allowing users to perform DeFi operations without exposing transaction amounts publicly on-chain.

The system operates on Solana Devnet and provides the following core capabilities:

Private Vault Deposits: Users deposit encrypted token amounts into yield-generating vaults
Encrypted Payments: Transfer encrypted tokens between addresses with hidden amounts
Token Wrapping: Convert standard tokens into encrypted equivalents (eTokens)
Balance Management: View and manage encrypted token balances with decrypt/encrypt operations
